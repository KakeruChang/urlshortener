## URL Shortener

This is a simple URL shortener service that generates a short URL for any long URL. The generated URL can then be used to redirect users to the original long URL.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Usage

After entering a URL directly into the input and clicking the send button, a short URL will be generated and displayed below. The generated URL will also be automatically copied to the user's clipboard. If the URL entered is invalid, an error message will be displayed, and no URL conversion will be performed.
